⚠️ This project is an old version of Hebei University Online Judge, which was based on the [DMOJ](https://github.com/DMOJ) open source project for secondary development. I would like to thank all members of the project team. We no longer maintain this project and re-develop a new [Programming Teaching Plaform](https://github.com/HBUCS/ProgramingTeachingPlatform) for Hebei University. (2019.2.20 - Boyce Li)
